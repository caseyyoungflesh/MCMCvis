Description: Performs key functions for MCMC analysis using minimal code - visualizes, manipulates, and summarizes MCMC output. Functions support simple and straightforward subsetting of model parameters within the calls, and produce presentable and 'publication-ready' output. MCMC output may be derived from Bayesian model output fit with 'Stan', 'NIMBLE', 'JAGS', and other software.
