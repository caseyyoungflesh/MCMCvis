Title: Tools to Visualize, Manipulate, and Summarize MCMC Output
Version: 0.9.1
Author: Casey Youngflesh
Maintainer: Casey Youngflesh <caseyyoungflesh@gmail.com>
Description: Performs key functions for MCMC analysis using minimal code - visualizes, manipulates, and summarizes MCMC output. Functions support simple and straightforward subsetting of model parameters within the calls, and produce presentable and 'publication-ready' output. MCMC output may be derived from Bayesian model output fit with JAGS, Stan, or other MCMC samplers.
